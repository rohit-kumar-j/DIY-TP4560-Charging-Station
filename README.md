A DIY TP4560 Charging Station.. can be for charging multiple 3.7V lipo batteries (for micro drones,diy projects,etc). I've used 5 over here, with dual SPDT and Pushbuttons to read the current and voltage (Yes,yes... I know.. I didn't have a triple SPDT with me hence the pushbuttons and the Dual SPDT)

* The Voltage across an individual battery can be read at a time in the Volt-Ammeter, with switching the spdt(engage  only one at a time and ) and the . 
* 9V battery is used to power the Volt-Ammeter and the charging station(not recomended). Instead, a 5V bench power supply is needed to power the TP4560 modules.
* Check the max current draw for the battery before charging. 


See this throughly **_entertaining and educational_** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCI61uYa44&ab_channel=Sorin-DIYElectricalNerd) for using an external resistor to bump up the charging current. 

**MAKE SURE TO READ THE DATASHEET OF BATTERIES TO CHECK THE MAX CHARGING CURRENT**
