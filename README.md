A DIY TP4560 Charging Station.. can be for charging multiple 3.7V lipo batteries (for micro drones,diy projects,etc). I've used 5 over here. Voltage across an individual battery can be read at a time in the Volt-Ammeter. 9V battery is used to power the Volt-Ammeter and the charging station(not recomended). 5V bench power supply is used to power the TP4560 modules.


See this throughly **_entertaining and educational_** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCI61uYa44&ab_channel=Sorin-DIYElectricalNerd) for using an external resistor to bump up the charging current. 

**MAKE SURE TO READ THE DATASHEET OF BATTERIES TO CHECK THE MAX CHARGING CURRENT**
